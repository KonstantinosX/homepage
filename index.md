I'm a graduate student at the University of Maryland, College Park.
My research interests lie in the broad field of Database Systems. I am likely interested in anything that has to do with any type of _large scale_ Database Systems and Graph Computation Frameworks. My more recent interest have sprung in the area of Distributed Databases, Isolation and Consistency.
