I'm a graduate student at the University of Maryland, College Park, working with Prof. Amol Deshpande.
In today's society, first managing and then gaining insight from the absurd amount of data that is being generated constantly is absolutely crucial. I find the idea of someday having fast and horizontally scalable systems to manage and analyze this data towards decision making or further gain of knowledge, fascinating.
My research lies in the broad field of Database Systems. I am generally interested in work that falls under _Large Scale_ Graph Computation Frameworks, Database Management Systems and Distributed Databases.
